# Contributing Guidelines

We love improvements to our tools! EDGI has general [guidelines for
contributing][edgi-contribute] to all of our organizational repos.

Here are some notes specific to this project:

* We have configured this project on CircleCI to [only run on pull
  requests and `master` branch][pr-config]. We have further configured
CircleCI to **NOT** delete videos from Zoom on runs related to pull
requests. (As mentioned in README, video are normally deleted after
upload.)
