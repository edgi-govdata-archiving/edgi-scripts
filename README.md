# EDGI Scripts

This is a repository for scripts that are part of EDGI's digital
infrastructure.

These scripts are usually intended to be run regularly in an automated
fashion

## Table of Contents

- [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)
- [Script Catalog](#script-catalog)

## Technologies Used

* [**CircleCI.**][circleci] A script-running service
  that [runs scheduled tasks][circleci-cron] for us in the cloud.

## Script Catalog

### Backup to Internet Archive: `archive.sh`

This script is used to run periodically and ensure that recent copies of
the EDGI website are backed up to the Internet Archive.

**Usage**

```
bash scripts/archive.sh envirodatagov.org
```

### Zoom-to-YouTube Uploader: `upload_zoom_recordings.py` and `auth.py`

This script cycles through Zoom cloud recordings and for each:

* uploads video to youtube as unlisted video
* adds it to a default playlist (which happens to be unlisted)
* sets video title to be `<Zoom title> - Mmm DD, YYYY` of recorded date
* **deletes** original video file from Zoom (**not** audio or chat log)

Note: the script isn't smart enough to detect duplicate videos being
uploaded more than once, but YouTube will recognize and disable them
after upload

#### Usage via CircleCI

[![Run scripts](https://img.shields.io/badge/scheduled%20scripts-RUN-44cc11.svg)][circleci-proj]
[![CircleCI Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/edgi-govdata-archiving/edgi-scripts.svg?label=CircleCI)][circleci-proj]

There is actually no need to run this script locally, as we have it
running daily on CircleCI (service explained above).

* We added our secret environment variables, (`EDGI_ZOOM_API_KEY` and
  `EDGI_ZOOM_API_SECRET`), to the [CircleCI configuration
file][circleci-config1] using the [documented method of encrypting
secrets][circleci-envvars].
* Using the [manual encryption method (OpenSSL
  variant)][circleci-encfile], we encrypted the secret Google-related JSON
files, (`client_secret.json` and `.youtube-upload-credentials.json`). We
used the above `EDGI_ZOOM_API_SECRET` as the password, since that's a
secret that CircleCI already knows. We stored the encrypted versions of
these two JSON files in the repo. We added a line to the [CircleCI
config][circleci-config2] to decrypt them for use when running in the
cloud.

**For automatic runs of the script:** It kicks off daily around 6am ET.

**For manual runs of the script:** Visit [our project page on the
CircleCI
platform][circleci-proj], and click the "Rebuild" button on the most
recent build number.

**Setup**

Quick reference for Ubuntu (may vary).

```
apt-get install python python-pip
pip install virtualenvwrapper
echo 'source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL
mkvirtualenv edgi-scripts --python=`which python3`
```

**Usage**

```
workon edgi-scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy client_secret.json to repo root dir. This is downloaded from
# Google API Console, and will need to be renamed.
# See: https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload#authentication

# Authorize YouTube app with EDGI account.
# This will need to be done from a system with a windowed browser (ie.
# not a server). It will generate a file named
# `.youtube-upload-credentials.json` in the repo root dir. If running the
# script on a server is required, you will # need to transfer this file
# from your # workstation onto the server.
python scripts/auth.py

# Prepare to download all videos from Zoom
# See: https://zoom.us/developer/api/credential
export EDGI_ZOOM_API_KEY=xxxxxxx
export EDGI_ZOOM_API_SECRET=xxxxxxxx

# Download from Zoom and upload to YouTube
python scripts/upload_zoom_recordings.py
```
